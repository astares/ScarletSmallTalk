The text you are reading here is the residue of something that has run before.
Keep the system running with responsibility. Smalltalk is not the words,
 nor any definition, nor it current contents...
Smalltalk include your feelings when you see it running.
Smalltalk is what happens when time flows and you "are" here.
Stop reading/writing code (thinking you are outside the system),
 change your world with resposibility, one object at a time, with your hands,
 during all your life, in family.
